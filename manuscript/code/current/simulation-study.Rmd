First, a function to help us generate our desired datasets.

```{r}
#function will generate a vector of numbers from the lognormal distribution
#function will take in arguments for 1) samplesize, 2) logmean, 3)logsd
#what column names do we need to run all our methods? --> true.value (numeric), below (boolean),


generateData <- function(sampsize, m, s){
  vector <- rlnorm(10000, 
                   meanlog=log(m^2 / sqrt(s^2 + m^2)),
                   sdlog=sqrt(log(1 + (s^2 / m^2))))
}
```
