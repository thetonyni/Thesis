idea: make colored map based on how many wells are in each state

```{r}
state_name <- state.name
state_abb <- state.abb
states_map <- map_data("state")

plot_usmap(data = states_n, values = "n", regions = "states") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "red", 
                        name = "Well Counts (2018)", 
                        label = scales::comma) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        panel.background = element_rect(color = "black", 
                                        fill = "white")) +
  ggtitle("Count of Groundwater Wells across U.S. States")
```

North Carolina has a significant number of wells amongst all states (over 100,000) compared to the next highest which is Indiana with around 58,000.


Let's focus in on North Carolina only for now!

```{r}
NC <- south %>%
  filter(state %in% "NC")

#count of sites
NC %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 13 different "sites" in which the wells can belong to.

```{r}
#count of disposal.area
NC %>%
  group_by(disposal.area) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Within each well, there are multiple disposal areas also (total count of 22).

```{r}
#count of gradient
NC %>%
  group_by(gradient) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

In the case for the NC wells, there are 92.169 downgradient wells and 14,063 upgradient wells.

# Dangerous Toxins in Coal Ash

Some of the most dangerous contaminants often found in coal ash include: arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, and selenium (https://www.psr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/coal-ash-toxics.pdf)

Are there different rates of censoring for different contaminants?

```{r}
NC_subset <- NC %>%
  filter(contaminant %in% c("Arsenic, dissolved", "Arsenic, total", 
                            "Lead, total", "Mercury, total", 
                            "Cadmium, dissolved", "Cadmium, total", 
                            "Chromium, total", "Selenium, Dissolved", 
                            "Selenium, Total")) %>%
  #exclude crossgradient and unknown
  filter(gradient %in% c("Upgradient", "Downgradient")) 

NC_subset2 <- NC_subset %>%
  group_by(contaminant, gradient, measurement.unit, below.detection) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
  
NC_subset3 <- NC_subset2[-c(27), ] #removing strange sole observation


NC_subset4 <- NC_subset3 %>%
  group_by(contaminant, gradient, measurement.unit) %>%
  summarize(prop = n/(sum(n))) %>%
  mutate(below.detection = case_when(
    row_number() %% 2 == 1 ~ "<", #odd
    row_number() %% 2 == 0 ~ "NA")) %>% #even  
  filter(below.detection %in% "<") %>%
  arrange(order(contaminant))

knitr::kable(NC_subset4)
```

Generally, when considering only the wells that have measurements below detection -- it seems like a higher proportion of the upgradient wells have measurements below detection when compared to their downgradient counterparts. This is to be expected -- upgradient wells are used to measure water quality before it passes through a coal ash plant, downgradient wells to measure water quality after passing through the plant. 

Ideally, we would like to know the average level of contamination (for a contaminant) with regards to upgradient and downgradient wells. However, due to the the proportions of measurements which are below the limit of detection being so high -- it may pose challenges in our endeavor. 

We could try to calculate averages without accounting for censoring to see what happens and then applying our methods and see if there are any differences. We have no way of knowing what the true averages will be due to so many being below the limit of detection -- however, we can definitely look to see if there are differences.

@Kelderman2019 compiled a list of the "top 10 most contaminated sites in the U.S." which I wanted to delve further into:

```{r}
top10 <- c("San Miguel Plant",
           "Allen Steam Station",
           "Jim Bridger Power Plant",
           "Naughton Power Plant",
           "New Castle Generating Station",
           "Allen Fossil Plant",
           "Brandywine Ash Management Facility",
           "Hunter Power Plant",
           "R.D. Morrow, Sr. Generating Station",
           "Ghent Generating Station")

top10df <- full %>%
  filter(site %in% top10)

top10df %>%
  group_by(site)%>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

/newpage

```{e}
#how many obs are below detection in each site
top10df %>%
  group_by(site, below.detection) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) 
```

There is a significant number of observations below the limit of detection which was not discussed (of being accounted for) in @Kelderman2019's report. I'm curious to see if the top 10 most contaminated sites in the U.S. would change, if we start accounting for these below detection values. 

\newpage 

How did the authors decide how to rank these top 10 sites by? They calculated a ratio of the "highest onsite average concentration of that pollutant to the health-based thresholds", and essentially the higher the ratio was -- the more dangerous that contaminant was determined to be. A contaminant with the ratio "x200" had concentrations that were 200 times greater than the health-based threshold. It is also essential to note that the authors only looked at the downgradient wells to determine if a well was contaminated or not (when in reality, the upgradient _could_ be contaminated also).

```{r, echo = FALSE, intervalcensoringexample, fig.cap="Interval Censoring Example", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/orig_top10.png")
```

We can apply the techniques in the simulation study (substitution, km, mle, ros) to estimate the average concentration of each contaminant in the downgradient wells across all sites, and compile a list of the top 10 wells, much like @Kelderman2019 did, and then compare to see whether or not if the list matches up -- and if the ratio changes if we use these methods to handle left-censored values.
