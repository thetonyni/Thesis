abstract = {In analytic chemistry a detection limit (DL) is the lowest measurable amount of an analyte that can be distinguished from a blank; many biomedical measurement technologies exhibit this property. From a statistical perspective, these data present inferential challenges because instead of precise measures, one only has information that the value is somewhere between 0 and the DL (below detection limit, BDL). Substitution of BDL values, with 0 or the DL can lead to biased parameter estimates and a loss of statistical power. Statistical methods that make adjustments when dealing with these types of data, often called left-censored data, are available in many commercial statistical packages. Despite this availability, the use of these methods is still not widespread in biomedical literature. We have reviewed the statistical approaches of dealing with BDL values, and used simulations to examine the performance of the commonly used substitution methods and the most widely available statistical methods. We have illustrated these methods using a study undertaken at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, to examine the serum bile acid levels in patients with colorectal cancer and adenoma. We have found that the modern methods for BDL values identify disease-related differences that are often missed, with statistically naive approaches.},

abstract = {Missing data imputation can help improve the performance of prediction models in situations where missing data hide useful information. This paper compares methods for imputing missing categorical data for supervised classification tasks. We experiment on two machine learning benchmark datasets with missing categorical data, comparing classifiers trained on non-imputed (i.e., one-hot encoded) or imputed data with different levels of additional missing-data perturbation. We show imputation methods can increase predictive accuracy in the presence of missing-data perturbation, which can actually improve prediction accuracy by regularizing the classifier. We achieve results comparable to the state-of-the-art on the Adult dataset with missing-data perturbation and k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) imputation.},

abstract = {The detection limit of an analytical method tells how low a concentration can be said to be measured. Users, laboratories, and equipment manufacturers prefer low ones. Industries under environmental regulation insist on honest ones. However, the detection limits of environmental regulations generally refer to relatively complex detection experiments (assays) or surveys that differ from the simple measurement operation that gave rise to the detection limit concept in analytical chemistry. The first contribution of this article is to clarify the limited scope of the simple definition and then define the population quantity that is being estimated. Such specificity allows alternative estimates to be evaluated more on statistical grounds of bias and variance rather than on whether they push the resulting value up or down. The fundamental statistical problem is to fit a variance function so that the derived relative standard deviation (RSD) function of concentration is smooth and monotone decreasing and thus can be inverted. The solution is to accept the best-fitting analytical version of the RSD function (log-log and hybrid models are described), fit it, invert it to get the point estimate, and provide a jackknife standard error. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Statistical Association and the International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Data subject to detection limits appear in a wide variety of studies. Data subject to detection limits are usually left-censored at the detection limit, often due to limitations in the measurement procedure being used. This thesis addresses three issues common to the analysis of data subject to detection limits. The first of these is the estimation of the limit of detection using repeated measurements from known analyte concentrations. An innovative change-point model is proposed to more accurately model the standard deviation of measured analyte concentrations, resulting in improved estimation of the limit of detection. The pro- posed methodology is applied to copy number data from an HIV pilot study. The second topic concerns estimation using generalized linear models when multiple covariates are subject to a limit of detection. We propose a Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm similar to that in Ibrahim, Lipsitz, and Chen to handle a large number of covariates subject to detection limits in generalized linear models. Censored covariate values are sampled using the Adaptive Rejec- tion Metropolis Algorithm of Gilks, Best, and Tan. This procedure is applied to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), in which values of urinary heavy metals are subject to a limit of detection. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed approach can lead to a significant reduction in variance for parameter estimates in these models, improving the power of such studies. The third and final topic addresses the joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data using time-varying covariates that are both intermittently missing and subject to a limit of detection. The model is motivated by data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), in which HIV+ subjects have viral load and CD4 cell counts measured at repeated visits along with survival data. The viral load data is subject to both left-censoring due to detection limits (17{\%}) and intermittent missing- ness (27{\%}). A Bayesian analysis is conducted on the MACS data using the proposed joint model. The proposed method is shown to improve the precision of estimates when compared to alternative methods.},

abstract = {With the need for emission measurements of super ultra low emission vehicles (SULEV), analyzer manufacturers have been required to produce more precise and accurate analyzers. In order to compare analyzers, the customer must understand the different specifications used by the analyzer manufacturers. One specification that some manufacturers have used is the limit of detection (LOD) to indicate the reliability of the analyzer output at low concentrations. There are various methods for determining the LOD for a given analyzer. The authors will demonstrate how variations in methodology can produce different LOD values for a specific analyzer and what it means for the automotive emission analyzers. It is also demonstrated that the standard deviations of a zero signal, which is related to LOD, can be heavily influenced by data processing, such as data length in use and/or data smoothing. The LOD values obtained will be compared to the limit of quantification (LOQ) for that analyzer. In order to evaluate the utility of LOD measurements, various analyzer performances will be modeled and evaluated. While the LOD is a valid statistical approach to determining the presence of a component in a sample matrix, it is not directly applicable to emissions measurements. A discussion about the emission measurement requirements will demonstrate the limited applicability of this analyzer specification. Alternative methods for comparing analyzer specifications will be presented and justified. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.},

Practical missing data analysis issues are discussed, most notably the inclusion of auxiliary variables for improving power and reducing bias. Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.},

@article{He2020,
abstract = {Measures of substance concentration in urine, serum or other biological matrices often have an assay limit of detection. When concentration levels fall below the limit, the exact measures cannot be obtained. Instead, the measures are censored as only partial information that the levels are under the limit is known. Assuming the concentration levels are from a single population with a normal distribution or follow a normal distribution after some transformation, Tobit regression models, or censored normal regression models, are the standard approach for analyzing such data. However, in practice, it is often the case that the data can exhibit more censored observations than what would be expected under the Tobit regression models. One common cause is the heterogeneity of the study population, caused by the existence of a latent group of subjects who lack the substance measured. For such subjects, the measurements will always be under the limit. If a censored normal regression model is appropriate for modeling the subjects with the substance, the whole population follows a mixture of a censored normal regression model and a degenerate distribution of the latent class. While there are some studies on such mixture models, a fundamental question about testing whether such mixture modeling is necessary, i.e. whether such a latent class exists, has not been studied yet. In this paper, three tests including Wald test, likelihood ratio test and score test are developed for testing the existence of such latent class. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the tests, and two real data examples are employed to illustrate the tests.},

The theory can also be applied to sub-micrometre size electrodes (nano-electrodes). The resulting equations can be utilised to analyse the number of impacts and its variance in the 'nano-impact' experiment. We also provide analytical expressions for the first passage time of an impact for dilute nanoparticle solutions in the continuum limit of Fickian diffusion. The expressions for the first passage times are used to estimate the lower limit of detection in ultra-dilute nanoparticle solutions for typical nano-impact experiments, and show the advantage of using microwire electrodes in ultra-dilute solutions or solutions containing larger nano-particles.},

abstract = {Analytical techniques for measuring trace arsenic (As) concentrations, such as the method described in this article, have much lower detection limits than conventional As measurement methods, and broader adoption of such methods could potentially drive a revision of the practical quantitation limit (PQL) for As in the future. Arsenic detection is limited by chloride interference in transmission quadrupole inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP/MS). However, high-resolution ICP/MS can measure As concentrations as low as 29 ng/L. The (nonenforceable) federal and California health standards for As are substantially lower than the PQL, so in the future a lower PQL could be a contributing factor when evaluating and reporting regulatory standards. These conclusions are likely to affect the decisions that water utility managers make about new and upgraded analytical equipment and treatment processes for As and other contaminants for which the PQL is currently greater than corresponding health standards. Water utility managers need to understand that the PQL is a moving target and incorporate that knowledge when planning for future analytical, reporting, and treatment operations.},
