# Introduction {#intro}

<!--
Each chapter file must start with a chapter header (e.g., # Chapter name). Notice we have also included a label after the chapter name ({# intro}) so we can refer back to this chapter later in the text if want to (e.g., by using \@ref(intro)). This also helps you debut potential issues as you knit.

You can knit chapters all at once using the index file, or individually. When you knit a single chapter, every other chapter will have a one-sentence placeholder to make knitting easier.

You can re-name each chapter file (e.g., change this filename from "01-chap1.Rmd" to "01-introduction.Rmd"), just make sure you also update the filename in the list of rmd files in _bookdown.yml.
-->

The introduction should provide an overview of the work you set out to do and provide structure for the remainder of the document.

## Background

* (coal ash report - car) coal one of the most dangerous combustible fossil fuels is comprised of a long list of dangerous chemicals -- including substances such as arsenic, radium, other carcinogens, metals that can impair developing children's brains, toxins dangerous to aquatic life, etc [@Kelderman2019]

* power plants produce 100mil tons of coal ash every year, which is dumped into landfills and waste ponds [@Kelderman2019]

* only recently (2015) have complaints and lawsuit arisen in which certain ecological organizations have attempted to sue the EPA to regulate disposal of coal ash [@Kelderman2019]

* this coal ash rule has forced power companies to make publicly available data regarding chemical concentrations in 265 coal plants containing ponds and landfills (about 3/4 of all coal power plants across the US) [@Kelderman2019]

* environmental agencies have concluded that the groundwater under basically all coal plants are contaminated [@Kelderman2019]

* HOWEVER this might be overstated? we wanted to investigate whether or not if this was true.

* wells are split into 2 different types - upgradient and downgradient

```{r, echo = FALSE, upgradientdowngradient, fig.cap="Difference Between Upgradient and Downgradient Wells", out.width = '100%'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/upgradientdowngradient.jpg")
```

* upgradient wells (background wells) measures groundwater chemical levels BEFORE passing through a coal ash dump while downgradient wells monitor the groundwater AFTER it passes through an ash dump

* we have reason to believe that many chemicals are NATURALLY OCCURING and as such, the statement made my environmental agencies regarding all groundwater being contaminated may be overstated

* typically, we would estimate the amount of chemical contamination, for this example -- arsenic -- caused by a coal ash dump with the equation: downgradient arsenic concentration minus upgradient arsenic concentration

* however, because there may be retired/unregulated upgradient wells that are occasionally contaminated already, this might be inaccurate

## Data
<!-- 
WHERE THE DATA CAME FROM
whichever website (talk about environmental integrity project) and what they did to get this data (use xlsx for this)
this data was publcicaly available, but EIP collated it someway to make it public
the data is NOT just a single of coalset, give examples of contaminants that itâ€™s taking measurements on
many sites within sites
-->

* EXPLAIN COAL ASH RULE HERE AND HOW THE EIP (Environmental Integrity Project) HAS HELPED MAKE THIS RULE

* the data used in the study is compiled and wrangled by the Environmental Integrity Project

* they obtained the data from an online, publicaly available database containing groundwater monitoring results from the first "Annual Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Reports" collected from coal plants and coal ash dumps which are regulated under the federal "Coal Ash Rule"

* WE MAY WANT TO CITE THIS WEBSITE https://environmentalintegrity.org/coal-ash-groundwater-contamination/ (this also contains good background knowledge to write the first bullet point above)

* TALK ABOUT VARIABLES AND WELLS/SITES HERE AND WHAT THEY MEAN

## Statistical Approaches
<!-- brief 2/3 sentences of work that has already been done -->

* we have already conducted a preliminary investigation using a variety of machine learning techniques to aid us in identifying potential contaminated upgradient wells

* we have also utilized bootstrapping and imputation techniques to correct for their measurements through by accounting for the innate contamination which may be caused by factors such as retired and unregulated wells

* our methodologies have yet to account for another problem however, involving limit of detection problem which arises from the measuring devices' inability to obtain chemical concentrations smaller than a certain threshold amount
