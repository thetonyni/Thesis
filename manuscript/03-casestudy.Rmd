# Case Study {#casestudy}

<!--
Each chapter file must start with a chapter header (e.g., # Chapter name). Notice we have also included a label after the chapter name ({# intro}) so we can refer back to this chapter later in the text if want to (e.g., by using \@ref(intro)). This also helps you debut potential issues as you knit.

You can knit chapters all at once using the index file, or individually. When you knit a single chapter, every other chapter will have a one-sentence placeholder to make knitting easier.

You can re-name each chapter file (e.g., change this filename from "01-chap1.Rmd" to "01-introduction.Rmd"), just make sure you also update the filename in the list of rmd files in _bookdown.yml.

The introduction should provide an overview of the work you set out to do and provide structure for the remainder of the document.

## Background {#background}

Coal is one of the most prevalent combustible fuels being burned all across the world, as it is one of the easiest methods of obtaining energy due to the abundance of the substance. Generally, coal plants produce electricity by burning coal, which produces coal ash as a byproduct. Over 100 million tons of coal ash are produced every year at these plants, which are then disposed through landfills and waste ponds at these plants. The main concern of ecologists regarding this matter is that the coal ash produced by these plants can often contaminate the local groundwater, leading to toxic contaminants being found in local water sources. Coal ash is dangerous due to its composition, which contains a long list of dangerous chemicals including -- but not limited to: arsenic, radium, boron, and a large list of other contaminants toxic to humans and animals alike [@Kelderman2019]. 

Complaints and concerns regarding the disposing practices of coal plants have only increased after the 2010 Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash incident in Tennessee. This area has become an attractive location in which many sites of ecological studies have been conducted the years following the incident. Leaching experiments conducted by @Ruhl2010 has revealed significant levels of dissolved Arsenic, Boron, Strontium, and Barium in the water which has been in contact with the coal ash, which they note to be threat to infaunal species in the water. Prompted by environmental organizations, groups, and individuals alike, an onslaught of pressure was put on the Environmental Protection Agency, which resulted in the Coal Ash Rule being put into effect in 2015 [@Kelderman2019].

This rule has forced over 265 coal power plants -- about 3/4 of all coal power plants in the US - to make data regarding chemical concentrations publicly available to the general population. In their analysis using this data, the @EIP2020 -- a non-profit organization dedicated to issues involving environmental justice, has discussed the prevalence of groundwater contamination for wells located near coal related facilities.

```{r, echo = FALSE, upgradientdowngradient, fig.cap="Difference Between Upgradient and Downgradient Wells", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/upgradientdowngradient.jpg")
```

Typically in a coal ash plant, there exists two types of wells: upgradient wells and downgradient wells. These wells are essential to measure the amount of contamination being caused by coal ash. Upgradient wells, also known as background wells, measures the concentrations of chemicals in groundwater before it passes through an coal ash dump. Conversely, downgradient wells measure the concentrations of chemicals in groundwater after it passes through a coal ash dump.

<!--With this information, typically -- one estimates the amount of chemical contamination caused by a coal as dump by subtracting the upgradient concentration from the downgradient concentration of a chemical (downgradient concentration - upgradient concentration). -->

While both types of well are susceptible to contamination through coal ash related means, it is more frequently the case that we focus on the downgradient wells, as they are more closely linked to the water accessed by the general public.

The goal of the study conducted by @Kelderman2019 was to identify the percentage of coal plants which have unsafe levels of contamination. Determining whether if a well was contaminated or not was largely influenced by the average mean concentrations of the contaminant in question for that well. If the average mean contamination of a contaminant, say, arsenic, was above the health-based threshold considered necessary to ensure safety, then that well would be marked as an "exceedance," and deemed to be contaminated.  

@Kelderman2019 notes the possibility of contamination being caused by an external factor, unrelated to the coal ash, and provides a stipulation as how to account for this. They excluded tallying the wells in which the mean downgradient values were lower than the mean upgradient values, as this would mean that the contamination was not caused by the coal plant itself.

-->

It is important to note where the data used originated from, before we delve into the details of our case study. As such, a brief history regarding the Coal Ash Rule and its origin will be explored, alongside details regarding our coal ash dataset.

### Coal Ash Rule {#coalashrule}

<!-- EXPLAIN COAL ASH RULE HERE AND HOW THE EIP (Environmental Integrity Project) HAS HELPED MAKE THIS RULE -->

A large coal ash spill at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which occurred on December 22, 2008 in Kingston, TN -- prompted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose a set of standardized regulations and procedures to address the concerns regarding coal ash plants nationwide in the US. This was known as the Coal Ash Rule, which passed legislation on December 19, 2014 [@Car2020].

Changes were made to the Coal Ash Rule over the years in the form of 'amendments,' in which the most relevant to this study, required coal facilities to publish information and data regarding the concentrations of contaminants in the wells.

### Source of Data

The data used in the study are from the results published in "Annual Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Reports," which were made available to the public in March 2018 as a result of the Coal Ash Rule. These reports are in PDF format and are thousands of pages long, which makes it difficult for individuals to parse through data in a meaningful way.

The @EIP2020 obtained the data from an online, publicly available database containing groundwater monitoring results from the first "Annual Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Reports" in 2018 which was collected from coal plants and coal ash dumps under the Coal Ash Rule.

They wrangled the data into a more accessible machine-readable format which contains information from over 443 annual groundwater monitoring reports posted by 265 coal ash plants, downloadable from the EIP's website, which we use in our case study.

### Variables {#variables}
<!-- TALK ABOUT VARIABLES AND WELLS/SITES HERE AND WHAT THEY MEAN -->

The coal dataset contains information regarding chemical concentrations at coal plants. A coal plant consists of multiple disposal areas for the coal ash that it produces. At each disposal area, there are specific locations that groundwater is being measured, known as wells, which represent an observation in the dataset. There are over 265 coal plants, also known as "sites," in this dataset. A single site is divided into multiple subsections, known as "disposal areas." Each well can be associated with a disposal area and subsequently, a site.

Specifics regarding the variables in the coal dataset can be viewed in Table 3.1. Each observation in the dataset represents a well which measures the concentration of the contaminant in question. Most of the variables are explanatory, such as the state, site, and disposal area in which the well is located in. However, there are several variables specific to groundwater data collection which are important to note.

There are four different types that each well can be classified as, which is represented in the `type` variable. These consist of: `L`, `M`, `SI`, and `U` which stand for "landfill," "mixed," "surface-impacted," and "unknown." We have already mentioned downgradient and upgradient wells during our discussion of the coal ash rule, but we will provide more detail now. In a groundwater monitoring system it is common to have designated wells for specific purposes. A common approach in a coal site is to have separate wells, upgradient wells, whose purpose is to measure "natural" water conditions and downgradient wells, which measures water conditions after it passes through a coal ash disposal area.

Coal plants may also follow different reporting protocols, which neccisitates the our "measurement unit," column. While some contaminants such as radium, are measured only in one unit (pCi/L) -- most others are measured differently across sites. One sits may measure arsenic with using milligrams/L while another site uses micrograms/L. 

The remaining variables in our dataset are mostly self explanatory, containing information regarding the date when sample was collected, unique ID of the well, and whether if the measurement is below the limit of detection.

### Plan of Action

The investigation conducted by @Kelderman2019 mentions certain restrictions within the data that we believe may have caused their analysis to potentially be inaccurate. The limit of detection problem arises when measuring devices used to measure chemical concentrations are unable to detect below a certain threshold, causing large numbers of observations to be considered "below detection." These values are often encoded as NA or even mistakenly marked as 0. 

Our end goal remains the same as the @Kelderman2019: to identify contaminated groundwater in coal plants. @Kelderman2019 handled these censored values by assuming that their concentration was one half of the detection limit. In essence, they employed the substitution method in in order to obtain calculations of the average concentrations of the downgradient and upgradient wells. From our previous discussion on sentiment regarding the substitution method and from our simulation study, we observe that the substitution method may not be the best way to handle left-censored data in most, if not all, of our settings.

The goal of our case study is to employ the techniques we introduced back in chapter 2 to see if they would result in potential differently conclusions. Specifically, we wish to check if the proportion of wells in the U.S. in which contamination is present would be altered if we used our techniques to calculate the average concentrations of the contaminants. Rather than utilizing the substitution method as @Kelderman2019 has done, we are interested to employ the MLE, KM, and ROS methods in handling for left-censored cases.

Our investigation works with methods on handling this missing data through the techniques detailed in chapter 1 in order to obtain more accurate and precise estimates of the mean concentrations of contaminants at coal ash sites. Through our newly obtained estimates, we hope to see if they might lead us to different beliefs than the claims made by @Kelderman2019 regarding the the top 10 most contaminated wells in the U.S.

### Background (tentative title)

As we can see from figure 3.2, out of the 265 sites in our dataset, most of them are concentrated heavily in the mid-western and southern areas of the United States. The report written by @Kelderman2019 pointed out that 91% of these sites (242 sites, to be precise) had groundwater wells with contaminants at an unsafe level determined by the health-based threshold put out by the EPA.

        plot.background = element_rect(color = "white"))
```

### Kelderman's Top 10 Sites

As stated previously, @Kelderman2019 compiled a list of the top ten most contaminated sites across the U.S., following the EPA's health-based threshold for specific contaminants. We will briefly follow with a discussion on their methodology in determining these top ten most contaminated sites.

First, they calculated the average mean concentration for all contaminants in each well across all dates. To ensure that all observations used in this calculation were attributable to the coal site in question, there are several guidelines that were followed.

After these values are obtained, any wells with average downgradient concentrations lower than the highest average upgradient concentration for that specific contaminant and disposal area were removed. It is also important to note that since upgradient wells measure the quality of the water _before_ it passes through a coal site, they are also removed.

These two exclusion principles are followed to ensure that we did not use any wells that potentially had contamination from an external source, apart from the coal site. The remaining average mean concentrations of the contaminants in question for each site are then compared to the health-based thresholds set by the EPA, these thresholds can be viewed in Table 3.2.

```{r echo = FALSE}
#CODE TO MAKE HEALTH BASED THRESHOLDS TABLE

hbt_names <- c("Antimony", "Arsenic", "Barium", "Beryllium",
               "Boron", "Cadmium", "Chromium", "Cobalt", "Fluoride",
               "Lead", "Lithium", "Mercury", "Molybdenum",
               "Radium", "Selenium", "Sulfate", "Thallium")

hbt_values <- c("6 ug/L", "10 ug/L", "2 mg/L",
                "4 ug/L", "3 mg/L", "5 ug/L",
                "100 ug/L", "6 ug/L", "4 mg/L",
                "15 ug/L", "40 ug/L", "2 ug/L",
                "40 ug/L", "5 pCi/L", "50 ug/L",
                "500 mg/L", "2 ug/L")

hbt <- as.data.frame(cbind(hbt_names, hbt_values)) %>%
  rename("Contaminant" = "hbt_names",
         "Exceedance Limit" = "hbt_values") 
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(hbt, caption = "Health-based thresholds set by EPA.",
             booktabs = "T", linesep = "\\addlinespace") %>%
             column_spec(3, width = "7.6cm")
```

For each site, the wells with the highest average concentration of each contaminant were identified and compared to their respective health-based thresholds. A ratio is then calculated for each of these highest average contaminants to the health-based thresholds. These contaminant-specific ratios are then summed together in order to get a cumulative "contamination score" for each site. Contamination scores of a higher magnitude indicates more "severe" contamination, with the top ten highest contamination scores comprising the top ten most contaminated sites.

While the contamination scores are not explicitly published in @Kelderman2019's report, the site names of the top ten most contaminated sites in the country according to their analysis which in descending order severity are as follows:

      1. San Miguel Plant,
      2. Allen Steam Station
      3. Jim Bridger Power Plant
      4. Naughton Power Plant
      5. New Castle Generating Station
      6. Allen Fossil Plant
      7. Brandywine Ash Management Facility
      8. Hunter Power Plant
      9. R.D. Morrow, Sr. Generating Station
      10. Ghent Generating Station

We will follow their criterion(s) for determining if a well is contaminated, with the only difference being how we obtain the average concentrations of the contaminants in the wells. We will use our four different methods to obtain mean estimates of the concentrations while accounting for the values below the limit of detection and see if we obtain any different conclusions.

### (Our) Top Ten Most Contaminated Sites

[code to be worked on here]

First, they calculated the average mean concentration for all contaminants in each well across all dates.

To ensure that all observations used in this calculation were attributable to the coal site in question, there are several guidelines that were followed.

After these values are obtained, any wells with average downgradient concentrations lower than the highest average upgradient concentration for that specific contaminant and disposal area were removed. It is also important to note that since upgradient wells measure the quality of the water _before_ it passes through a coal site, they are also removed.

These two exclusion principles are followed to ensure that we did not use any wells that potentially had contamination from an external source, apart from the coal site.
