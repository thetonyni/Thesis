<!--
Each chapter file must start with a chapter header (e.g., # Chapter name). Notice we have also included a label after the chapter name ({# intro}) so we can refer back to this chapter later in the text if want to (e.g., by using \@ref(intro)). This also helps you debut potential issues as you knit.

You can knit chapters all at once using the index file, or individually. When you knit a single chapter, every other chapter will have a one-sentence placeholder to make knitting easier.

You can re-name each chapter file (e.g., change this filename from "01-chap1.Rmd" to "01-introduction.Rmd"), just make sure you also update the filename in the list of rmd files in _bookdown.yml.

The introduction should provide an overview of the work you set out to do and provide structure for the remainder of the document.

## Background {#background}

Coal is one of the most prevalent combustible fuels being utilized all over the world, as it is one of the easiest methods of obtaining energy due to the abundance of the substance. Generally, coal plants produce electricity by burning coal, which produces coal ash as a byproduct. Over 100 million tons of coal ash are produced every year at these plants, which are then disposed through landfills and waste ponds at these plants. The main concern of ecologists regarding this matter is that the coal ash produced by these plants can often contaminate the local groundwater, leading to toxic contaminants being found in local water sources. Coal ash is dangerous due to its composition, which contains a long list of dangerous chemicals including -- but not limited to: arsenic, radium, boron, and other contaminants which have been found to be toxic to humans and animals alike [@Kelderman2019]. 

Only recently has there been an increase in the frequency of complaints and concerns regarding the disposing practices of coal plants. This is due to disturbances at coal plants, such as the 2010 Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash incident in Tennessee. This area has become an attractive location in which many sites of ecological studies have been conducted the years following the incident. Leaching experiments conducted by @Ruhl2010 has revealed significant levels of dissolved arsenic, boron, strontium, and barium in the water which has been in contact with the coal ash, which they specifically note to be threat to aquatic life in the surrounding area. Prompted by environmental organizations, groups, and individuals alike, an onslaught of pressure was put on the Environmental Protection Agency, which resulted in the Coal Ash Rule being put into effect in 2015 [@Kelderman2019].

This rule has forced over 265 coal plants -- about 3/4 of all coal plants in the US -- to make data regarding chemical concentrations publicly available to the general population. In their analysis using this data, the @EIP2020, a non-profit organization dedicated to environmental justice issues, have discussed the prevalence of groundwater contamination for in the wells located in these coal related facilities.

```{r, echo = FALSE, upgradientdowngradient, fig.cap="Difference Between Upgradient and Downgradient Wells", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/upgradientdowngradient.jpg")
```

Typically in a coal ash plant, there exists two types of wells: upgradient wells and downgradient wells. These wells are essential to measure the amount of contamination being caused by coal ash. Upgradient wells, also known as background wells, measures the concentrations of chemicals in groundwater before it passes through an coal ash dump. Conversely, downgradient wells measure the concentrations of chemicals in groundwater after it passes through a coal ash dump. Figure \ref{fig:upgradientdowngradient} is a useful visualization detailing the specifics regarding the differences between the two types of wells. While both types of well are susceptible to contamination through coal ash related means, it is more frequently the case that we focus on the concentrations of downgradient wells as they are good indicators of possible contamination in the water being accessed by the general public.

The goal of the study conducted by @Kelderman2019 was to identify the percentage of coal plants which have unsafe levels of contamination. High concentrations of toxic chemicals are what classify a well as being contaminated or not. More specifically, we obtain the mean concentrations of the contaminant in question for all the wells measuring a specific chemical in a site. If the mean contamination of a contaminant in question, say, arsenic, was above the health-based thresholds set by the EPA, then that well would be marked as an "exceedance," and deemed to be contaminated.  

@Kelderman2019 notes the possibility of contamination being caused by an external factor, unrelated to the coal ash, and provides a stipulation as how to account for this. In the process of calculating mean concentrations, they excluded wells in which the mean downgradient values were lower than the mean upgradient values, as this would mean that the contamination was not caused by the coal plant itself. They also exclude upgradient wells in this calculation, as the focus is on possible contamination in downgradient well in the coal plant.

## Data {#data}

It is important to note where the data used originated from, before we delve into the details of our case study. As such, a brief history regarding the Coal Ash Rule and its origin will be explored, alongside details regarding our coal ash dataset.

### Coal Ash Rule {#coalashrule}

A large coal ash spill at the Tennessee Valley Authority which occurred on December 22, 2008 in Kingston, TN -- prompted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose a set of standardized regulations and procedures to address the concerns regarding coal ash plants nationwide in the US. This was known as the Coal Ash Rule, which passed legislation on December 19, 2014 [@Car2020]. Over the years, several changes were made to the Coal Ash Rule in the form of amendments. One of these amendments (published on the April 15, 2015) stated that coal plants would be required to publish data regarding the concentrations of contaminants in the wells and other facility information to the general public. 

### Source of Data

The data used in the study are from a collection of results published by each coal plant in their "Annual Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Reports." These reports are coal-specific, in PDF format, and can often be up to thousands of pages long, which makes it difficult for individuals to parse through data in a meaningful way. Due to this inaccessibility, the @EIP2020 began a long project to parse and wrangle through these reports to compile them into a more accessible machine-readable format. This compilation contains information from over 443 annual groundwater monitoring reports posted by 265 coal ash plants, and is downloadable from the EIP's website. This dataset compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project are what we will utilize in our case study.

### Variables {#variables}

The coal dataset contains information regarding chemical concentrations at coal plants. A coal plant consists of multiple disposal areas for the coal ash that it produces. At each disposal area, there are specific locations that groundwater is being measured, known as wells, which represent an observation in the dataset. There are over 265 coal plants, also known as "sites," in this dataset. A single site is divided into multiple subsections, known as "disposal areas." Each well can be associated with a disposal area and subsequently, a site.

Specifics regarding the variables in the coal dataset can be viewed in Table \ref{tab:datadict}. Each observation in the dataset represents a well which measures the concentration of the contaminant in question. Most of the variables are explanatory, such as the state, site, and disposal area in which the well is located in. However, there are several variables specific to groundwater data collection which are important to note.

There are four different types that each well can be classified as, which is represented in the `type` variable. These consist of: `L`, `M`, `SI`, and `U` which stand for "landfill," "mixed," "surface-impacted," and "unknown." We have already mentioned downgradient and upgradient wells during our discussion of the coal ash rule, but we will provide more detail now. In a groundwater monitoring system it is common to have designated wells for specific purposes. A common approach in a coal site is to have separate wells, upgradient wells, whose purpose is to measure "natural" water conditions and downgradient wells, which measures water conditions after it passes through a coal ash disposal area.

Coal plants may also follow different reporting protocols, which necessitates the "measurement unit" column. While some contaminants such as radium, are measured only in one unit (pCi/L) -- most others are measured differently across sites. One site may measure arsenic with using milligrams/L while another site uses micrograms/L. 

The remaining variables in our dataset are mostly self explanatory, containing information regarding the date when sample was collected, unique ID of the well, and whether if the measurement is below the limit of detection. A data dictionary of all variables in the dataset can be viewed in Table \ref{tab:datadictionary}.

```

### Plan of Action

The investigation conducted by @Kelderman2019 mentions certain restrictions within the data that we believe may have caused their analysis to potentially be inaccurate. The limit of detection problem arises when measuring devices used to measure chemical concentrations are unable to detect below a certain threshold, causing large numbers of observations to be considered "below detection." These values are often encoded as NA or even mistakenly marked as 0. 

Our end goal remains the same as the original research question proposed by @Kelderman2019, which is to identify (the top ten most) contaminated coal plants. Around 2/3 of all wells in the dataset have concentrations found to be below the detection limit. This is a significant portion of the data being censored, which we believe may have significant consequences in the results obtained during analysis. @Kelderman2019 handled these censored values by assuming that their concentration was one half of the detection limit. In essence, they employed the substitution method we discussed previously, with a replacement value of $\frac{1}{2}$ LOD for the values below the detection limit. 

The goal of our case study is to employ the techniques we introduced back in chapter 2 to see if they would result in potential differently conclusions. Specifically, we wish to check if the proportion of wells in the U.S. in which contamination is present would be altered if we used our mean estimation techniques to calculate the average concentrations of the contaminants. We would also like to implement a baseline (control) method in which we calculate mean estimates while disregarding the censoring status of the observations and see if our methods truly offer any different conclusions than the claims made by @Kelderman2019 regarding the top 10 most contaminated wells in the U.S.

As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:usmap}, out of the 265 sites in our dataset, most are concentrated heavily in the mid-western and southern areas of the United States. The report written by @Kelderman2019 pointed out that 91% of these sites (242 sites, to be precise) had groundwater wells with contaminants at an unsafe level determined by the health-based threshold put out by the EPA.

```

### Kelderman's Top 10 Sites

As stated previously, @Kelderman2019 compiled a list of the top ten most contaminated sites across the U.S., following the EPA's health-based threshold for specific contaminants. We will briefly follow with a discussion on their methodology in determining these top ten most contaminated sites.

First, they calculated the average mean concentration for all contaminants in each well across all dates. To ensure that all observations used in this calculation were attributable to the coal site in question, there are several guidelines that were followed.

After these values are obtained, any wells with average downgradient concentrations lower than the highest average upgradient concentration for that specific contaminant and disposal area were removed. It is also important to note that since upgradient wells measure the quality of the water _before_ it passes through a coal site, they are also removed.

These two exclusion principles are followed to ensure that we did not use any wells that potentially had contamination from an external source, apart from the coal site. The remaining average mean concentrations of the contaminants in question for each site are then compared to the health-based thresholds set by the EPA, these thresholds can be viewed in Table \ref{tab:hbt}.

```{r hbttable, echo = FALSE}
#CODE TO MAKE HEALTH BASED THRESHOLDS TABLE

hbt_names <- c("Antimony", "Arsenic", "Barium", "Beryllium",
               "Boron", "Cadmium", "Chromium", "Cobalt", "Fluoride",
               "Lead", "Lithium", "Mercury", "Molybdenum",
               "Radium", "Selenium", "Sulfate", "Thallium")

hbt_values <- c(6, 10, 2, 4, 
                3, 5, 100, 6, 4,
                15, 40, 2, 40, 
                5, 50, 500, 2)

hbt_units <- c("ug/L", "ug/L", "mg/L", "ug/L", 
               "mg/L", "ug/L", "ug/L", "ug/L", "mg/L",
               "ug/L", "ug/L", "ug/L","ug/L", 
               "pCi/L", "ug/L", "mg/L", "ug/L")

hbt <- as.data.frame(cbind(hbt_names, hbt_values, hbt_units)) %>%
  rename("Contaminant" = "hbt_names",
         "Exceedance Limit" = "hbt_values",
         "Unit" = "hbt_units") 
```

```{r hbt, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(hbt, caption = "Health-based thresholds set by EPA.",
             booktabs = "T", linesep = "\\addlinespace")
```

For each site, the wells with the highest average concentration of each contaminant were identified and compared to their respective health-based thresholds. A ratio is then calculated for each of these highest average contaminants to the health-based thresholds. These contaminant-specific ratios are then summed together in order to get a cumulative "contamination score" for each site. Contamination scores of a higher magnitude indicates more "severe" contamination, with the top ten highest contamination scores comprising the top ten most contaminated sites.

While the contamination scores are not explicitly published in @Kelderman2019's report, the site names of the top ten most contaminated sites in the country according to their analysis which in descending order severity are as follows:

      1. San Miguel Plant,
      2. Allen Steam Station
      3. Jim Bridger Power Plant
      4. Naughton Power Plant
      5. New Castle Generating Station
      6. Allen Fossil Plant
      7. Brandywine Ash Management Facility
      8. Hunter Power Plant
      9. R.D. Morrow, Sr. Generating Station
      10. Ghent Generating Station

We will follow their criterion(s) for determining if a well is contaminated, with the only difference being how we obtain the average concentrations of the contaminants in the wells. We will use our several left-censored estimation techniques to obtain mean estimates of the concentrations while accounting for the values below the limit of detection and see if our results significantly differ from the top ten list of most contaminated sites obtained by @Kelderman2019. We will also have a baseline implementation of the methods described by @Kelderman2019, without any attempts to account for the censored data. This implementation will serve as our control in which we will compare our left-censored estimation techniques towards.

The results from our baseline implementation which calculates mean estimates without any attempt to account for censoring, obtains the top ten sites presented in Table \ref{tab:top10baseline}. When comparing this to the original substitution method using 1/2(LOD) implemented by @Kelderman2019, 9 out of the 10 sites are shared, with the only major difference being the order in which the sites are presented. As the composite scores of the sites were not originally published in @Kelderman2019's report, we are unable to delve into more of the specifics regarding the magnitude of difference between the two implementations. As such, we found it prudent to perform their analysis using the substitution method, the results of which are presented in Table \ref{tab:top10substitution}. 

Something unexpected to note is that although we followed the procedures outlined by @Kelderman2019 in their implementation of the substitution method, our top ten sites presented in Table \ref{tab:top10km} somewhat differ from theirs. Reproducible code was not provided in their report and attempts to completely reproduce their top ten list would not be conducive to the goal of this report. As such, from now on, we will proceed with the analysis with _our_ top ten list produced by the substitution method as the norm, for the sake of comparability with our other methods.

It is also important to note that the MLE method and the ROS method are absent from this case-study. It can be recalled that in our previous discussion regarding the MLE method, we discussed noted a limitation of the MLE method being how it can obtain overinflated estimates when the data is highly skewed. In our attempt to use the MLE method, we found that the estimates we obtained did not provide very useful information. To exemplify this, we had one well with an abnormally large concentration, a sign that it was most likely contaminated, and hundreds of smaller wells in which the concentration is 0. The MLE method gave us mean estimates nearing infinity, which threw our analysis into disarray. As such, we refrained from utilizing the MLE method in this specific case study.

The ROS method was absent for a similar reason, but with the limitations more-so being on the capabilities of the method itself. As we discussed previously, the ROS method can only be used in settings when more than half the data is uncensored. Unfortunately with our data, censoring far exceeds 50%, and as such, the ROS method is unable to be implemented [@EPA2009].

The top ten sites obtained using our substitution implementation are the same sites as the ones obtained from our baseline implementation, with the same ordering but slight differences in the composite scores. With our KM method, the Ghent Generating Station replaces the Sebree Generating Station as one of the top ten most contaminated sites, with some slight differences in the ordering of the sites in the latter half of the list. 

It is not a surprise that our left-censoring mean estimation techniques did not provide much of a different result than what we obtained with our baseline implementation. Left-censoring techniques are not as useful with this case-study, where we are focused on finding the extremities of the dataset, i.e. wells with the highest concentration of contaminants. If the research question was instead, identifying wells that were potentially contaminated, the distinction between the results obtained by these methods would be more visible. @Kelderman2019's implementation of the substitution method as a way to account for left-censoring is justifiable due to its ease of implementation and the results we just discussed. We do not observe any significant differences in the top ten sites when comparing all three implementations we used.
