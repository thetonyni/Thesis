Missing data is ubiquitious in statistics: from nonresponse in survey studies to issues with data collection in field studies, it is often unavoidable to encounter missing data in practice. Our thesis begins with an overview of missingness, specifically with 
left-censored data, and introduces four common methods: substitution, maximum likelihood, Kaplan-Meier, and regression on order statistics, which are commonly used to handle left-censored missingness. We follow this discussion by performing a simulation study, designed to compare and contrast the effectiveness of these methods, while taking into account the distribution of the simulated data, censoring rates, and the size of the dataset. Finally, we explore left-censored data in a case-study focusing on coal ash contamination in groundwater wells and use our four methods to obtain mean estimates of contaminant concentrations to identify the top ten most contaminated wells across the U.S.
