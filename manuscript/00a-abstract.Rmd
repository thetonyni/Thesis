The abstract should be a short summary of your thesis work. A paragraph is usually sufficient here.

Missing data is ubiquitious in statistics: from nonresponse in survey studies to issues with data collection in field studies, it is 
often unavoidable to encounter missing data in practice. Our thesis begins with an overview of missingness, specifically with 
left-censored data, and introduces four different methods: substitution, maxmimum likelihood, kaplan-meier, and regression on order 
statistics to combat this. We explore a simulation study to compare and contrast the effectiveness of these methods when considering 
for the distribution of the data, censoring rates, and the size of the dataset in order to validate several claims made in several 
papers regarding these methods. Finally, we explore left-censored data in the form of coal ash contamination in groundwater wells, 
and apply our findings to this case study. Our results from our simulation study show that BLAH.
