Throughout the writing of this thesis, I have garnered an immense amount of guidance and support from my advisors, professors, and friends.

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor, Brittney Bailey, for her unwavering belief in me and my skills during the writing of this thesis. Her expertise and knowledge in the field has aided me in all stages of my thesis writing process: from the formulation of a research topic, literature search, and the writing of the actual thesis itself. I would not have been able to write my thesis in this period of tumultuous events if it were not for her steadfast support and encouragement, and for that, I cannot express my utmost gratitude. 

I would also like to thank all of my professors who have guided me thus far in my academic journey in statistics. Professor Amy Wagaman for her countless help throughout the years as my major advisor, professor, and mentor. Professor Nick Horton for helping instill values of statistical integrity and sharing his love of all fields of statistics to me; Professor Donges for fostering my knowledge in probability and theory; and Professor Katharine Correia for cultivating my enthusiasm for data science and statistical applications. I don't think that I would be here writing a thesis, without their teachings, guidance, and support over my four years at Amherst.

I also need to thank my friends who have been alongside me throughout our statistical journey at Amherst: Breanna Richards, Jasper Flint, and Sabir Meah, our early morning, mid-afternoon, and even late night homework and study sessions, especially after the pandemic, helped keep me sane and motivated in a time where I had trouble keeping hope. Perhaps also just for the good conversation too.

Thank you also to all the people in the Greenway Group over my four years at Amherst who have motivated me in my times of darkness, lifted me up in times of doubt, and cheered me on in all my pursuits.
